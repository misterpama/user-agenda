# user-agenda
This spring boot application is a simple implementation of an agenda.
Each member has a name, a surname, an e-mail and an address.
You can add, edit or delete members, you can also filter the member list by name or surname, and you can upload members to the list from a .csv file.
Inside the project you can find a file named "upload-test.csv" as an import example.
